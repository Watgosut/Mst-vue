            <p>
                If you'd like to help me out, I'd really appreciate you spending the time to go through and do my evaluation of this app. It's at this   <el-link type="primary" href="https://docs.google.com/forms/d/e/1FAIpQLSfmWURhjiBQg3IKC8BGb11JiyHxl2crmGKU760t4ra1HBR09Q/viewform?usp=pp_url">Google Forms Link.</el-link>
            </p>
            <p>
                If there's anything you'd like to mention that my evaluation doesn't cover, please contact me at 2490062j@student.gla.ac.uk. I'd love to hear any and all opinions!

            <h2>Future Work</h2>
            <p>As this is a university project, the things I can do within the given time are limited, especially when dealing with other academic pursuits simultaneously. But if time permits, the following is a list of features, fixes, and improvements I hope to complete:</p>
            <p> 1. Implementation of more algorithms</p>
            <p> 2. Support some application scenarios</p>
            <p> 3. Further beautify the display of the Graph</p>
            <p> 4. Mobile version of the web app</p>
            <p> 5. Add a function that supports users to write and compile code, allowing them to see the running process of the code instead of pseudocode</p>
