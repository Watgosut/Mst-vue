                  <p>This website was developed as my undergraduate graduation project under the guidance of my project supervisor, Sofiat Olaosebikan, aiming to help users understand the Minimum Spanning Tree (MST) and its algorithms (Kruskal and Prim algorithms) through a visual learning experience. </p>
                  <!--              <br />-->
                  <p>Over the past six months, under the guidance of my project supervisor, Sofiat Olaosebikan, I have designed, developed, and continually improved mst-vue. The goal of this project is not only to demonstrate how the Minimum Spanning Tree algorithms work but also to make theoretical knowledge more understandable and accessible through interactive learning.</p>

                  <h2 style="color: #409EFF">The core features of the mst-vue website include:</h2>
                  <h3>Visual Demonstrations</h3>
                  <p>Users can visually see each step of the Kruskal and Prim algorithms in generating the Minimum Spanning Tree.</p>

                  <h3>Interactive Learning</h3>
                  <p>Through participatory operations, users can try the steps of the algorithm themselves, deepening their understanding of the algorithms.</p>

                  <h3>Theoretical and Practical Integration</h3>
                  <p>In addition to visual and interactive experiences, the website also provides theoretical background information on the Minimum Spanning Tree and related algorithms.</p>
